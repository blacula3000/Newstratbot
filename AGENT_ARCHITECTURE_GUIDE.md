# Agent Architecture Guide

## Overview

The Enhanced Event-Driven Trading Architecture represents a sophisticated, institutional-grade trading system that replaces traditional batch processing with real-time event-driven analysis. This multi-agent ensemble provides comprehensive market analysis, risk management, and trade execution capabilities.

## Architecture Principles

### Event-Driven Design
